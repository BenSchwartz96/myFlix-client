# MyFlix
This is a portfolio project. It's the bones of a website where one could find information about movies, directors, and genres, and register their own favorites.
Live demo [_here_](https://bms-myflix.netlify.app/).


## General Information
- This app currently only has basic functionality, and crucially is missing a fully populated database of movies to draw from. 


## Features
- Make an account and edit your profile
- Add or remove favorite movies to your profile.
- Find out, for each movie, who the director was and what the genres are.

## Technologies

- React
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose for the API

## Project Status
Project is: _not currently being worked on_. This is because setting up the basic functionality and learning the relevant concepts (most notably, React/React Bootstrap) was the central goal of this project.
